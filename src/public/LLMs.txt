[VENTURES & PROJECTS]

(1) Project: Portfolio Pulse
  - Role: Sole Developer & Architect
  - Domain: Financial Technology (FinTech)
  - Objective: To replace a slow, manual, and error-prone process of portfolio analysis with an automated, real-time Management Information System (MIS).
  - Problem Solved: Executives at Global IME Capital lacked a quick and clear way to view the performance and allocation of client portfolios. The existing process involved manual consolidation of Excel sheets, which was time-consuming and lacked interactivity.
  - Solution: Developed a web-based application using Next.js that allows users to upload raw portfolio data from Excel files directly in the browser. The application processes the data on the client-side to generate interactive dashboards, charts, and tables.
  - Key Features: In-browser data processing, real-time performance metrics (gain/loss, allocation by sector), interactive data visualizations using Recharts.
  - Impact: Successfully deployed and used internally at Global IME Capital. It provided unprecedented clarity and speed to portfolio supervision, enabling faster, data-driven decision-making.
  - Technologies: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, Recharts.

(2) Project: MeroShare Automation Suite
  - Role: Creator
  - Domain: Automation, Personal Finance
  - Objective: To eliminate the repetitive manual effort required for common tasks on the MeroShare platform, the central portal for retail investors in Nepal.
  - Problem Solved: Applying for IPOs and completing eDIS transfers are high-frequency, tedious tasks that are prone to human error.
  - Solution: Developed a set of Python scripts using the Selenium library to automate browser interactions with the MeroShare website.
  - Key Features: Automated IPO applications, automated eDIS completion, custom verification workflows to ensure correctness.
  - Impact: Provided a tool for personal use and for the community that saves significant time and reduces the risk of missing deadlines or making mistakes. A demonstration video is available on YouTube.
  - Technologies: Python, Selenium.

(3) Project: Auto Form Filler for PMS
  - Role: Developer
  - Domain: Automation, FinTech
  - Objective: To drastically reduce the time and effort required for the client onboarding process in Portfolio Management Services (PMS).
  - Problem Solved: The manual process of filling out lengthy and complex PDF forms for each new PMS client at Global IME Capital took over 2 hours per client and was susceptible to data entry errors.
  - Solution: Created a Python-based utility that reads client data from a structured source (like an Excel sheet) and programmatically fills out the required PDF forms with perfect accuracy.
  - Evolution: The project started as a command-line interface (CLI) tool and later evolved into a user-friendly desktop GUI application using PyQt6, complete with light and dark themes.
